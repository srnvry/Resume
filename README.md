**Deployment of RedHat Openstack HCI with Baremetal Openshift, Red Hat Virtualization, RedHat IDM, Ansible Tower and Satellite** Time- Oct/2021 to Feb/2022
- Worked  on personal cloud infrastructure Design and  Deployment,  We have 3 sites  2 have production and one have staging environment, both production sites located in two geological locations and It’s  for a telco client.
Worked on deployment RedHat Openstack v16.2 HCI model (RedHat Openstack v16.2 and Redhat ceph storage v4) and RedHat Openshift on top of RedHat Openstack  and 5 node openshift on bare metal and 5 node openshift on Red Hat Virtualization for infrastructure monitoring. Both sites have separate  Red Hat Virtualization for management zones. On Red Hat Virtualization we have deployed openshift, ansible tower, IDM, and Satellite server .
- **RedHat Openstack v16.2 HCI Model -** Worked on deployment RedHat Openstack  16.2 with RedHat Ceph storage, we have 140 node with there different different capabilities on both site, 3 node stand for controller where RedHat Openstack  and ceph service running and 5 type of compute node (Com, HCI, Lake, Bss, Win). HCI nodes have extra 18 storage disk for ceph OSD and 2 nvme disk for ceph journaling, Lake node have 11 disk which is configured in Raid5  it is encrypted and it is available for nova instances. Cinder storage have multiple backend like ceph storage, FC Netapp and local encrypted storage  
- **RedHat Ceph storage -** Worked on deployment ceph storage with 25 OSD servers. ceph storage is the backend of cinder, manila, swift  and it also shares storage through nfs to the end user.
- **Openshift -**  Worked on deployment RedHat Openshift on Red Hat Virtualization, bare metal and RedHat Openstack.  I help in RedHat Openshift deployment On RedHat Openstack  and bare metal  we deployed it for customer application and On Red Hat Virtualization we deployed it for RedHat Openstack  monitoring.
